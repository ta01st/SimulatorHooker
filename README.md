SimulatorHooker
==========

A useful toolset for developer (at least for me) for testing their apps on iOS simulator.

Injector library would take care of loading code into UIKit applications.

Tested on Xcode 8 beta, iOS 10 beta, with latest branch of theos.

Most tweaks are (re)written using ZKSwizzle.

Code, Compile, Update, and Yay.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
